# Credit-X Payment Reminder Optimization  
**Redesigning the Reminder Strategy to Improve Customer Experience and Reduce Delinquency**

---


Credit-X is facing **customer dissatisfaction** due to its **ineffective payment reminder system**. Feedback highlights several pain points:
- Inconsistent reminder frequency (some months have none, others have too many)
- Poor timing of messages across the year
- No customization or personalization options

These issues have contributed to **~10% monthly delinquency rates**, causing unnecessary interest charges and lowering customer satisfaction.

---

##  Goal

Redesign the payment reminder communication strategy using data-driven insights, with the following objectives:
- Improve the effectiveness of reminders
- Reduce the delinquency rate
- Enhance the customer experience

---

##  Conceptual Model

To understand the ecosystem, we structured the system relationships conceptually as follows:

##  Synthetic Data Generation

To support robust analysis and experimentation, the dataset was synthetically generated using statistical distributions and economic principles that mirror real-world financial behavior. Each table in the dataset was designed to reflect realistic variability, customer behavior patterns, and macroeconomic trends over time.

### Key Design Principles:

- **Customer Risk Tiers** were assigned using the Pareto principle: most customers fall into the low-risk segment, while a smaller group accounts for most delinquencies. This simulates the structure of real financial portfolios.

- **Credit Scores** were generated based on the customer‚Äôs risk tier, following normal distributions with different means and standard deviations. This reflects how actual credit scores cluster by financial health.

- **Credit Limits** follow a heavy-tailed Pareto distribution, where a small portion of customers hold disproportionately high credit limits‚Äîcommon in credit card and lending products.

- **Delinquency Probability** increases each year to simulate economic downturns. A logistic-like scaling was applied depending on customer risk tier and the year, representing how financial pressure accumulates over time.

- **Days Late** for payments follow a Weibull distribution, commonly used in failure-time modeling. This captures the fact that most payments are only slightly late, but some are delayed significantly.

- **Reminder Engagement** follows an exponential decay model. The probability of engaging (e.g., opening a message) decreases with each additional reminder, but improves slightly year-over-year due to better technology and communication strategies.

- **Seasonal Payment Amounts** were adjusted using a sinusoidal function to reflect holiday-driven spending behavior‚Äîpeaking in December and dipping early in the year.

- **Partial Payments** were modeled using a beta distribution to reflect the fact that customers are more likely to make underpayments than overpayments, while staying within realistic bounds.

|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Customer segmentation    | Discrete distribution (Pareto rule)    | Few high-risk customers drive majority of delinquencies       |
| Credit capacity          | Power-law distribution                 | Wealth and credit inequality                                  |
| Creditworthiness         | Gaussian distribution per risk tier    | Credit scores cluster predictably by risk                     |
| Payment behavior         | Weibull and logistic scaling           | Payment delays and delinquency escalate under stress          |
| Engagement with reminders| Exponential decay with tech gain       | Drop-off in user response, improved by better systems         |
| Seasonality              | Trigonometric cycles                   | Spending peaks during holidays                                |

##  Analytical Framework

We structured the analysis by mapping key metrics from each table to their roles in the business question.

|--------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `reminders`  | `opened`, `clicked`, `payment_triggered`     | Channel effectiveness & customer engagement    |
| `payments`   | `days_late`, `amount_paid`                   | Customer payment behavior & delinquency trends |
| `customers`  | `risk_tier`, `income_bracket`                | Customer segmentation & targeting              |
| `schedules`  | `due_date`, `amount_due`                     | Reminder coverage & payment scheduling         |
